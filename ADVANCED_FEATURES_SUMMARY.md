## 🤖 Part 1: Advanced AI Features

### 1. **Streaming Responses** (Real-Time Typing Effect)

**What it does:** AI responses stream in real-time, token by token, creating a ChatGPT-like typing effect.

**New Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/v1/stream/chat
```

**How it works:**
- Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming
- Sends tokens as they're generated by Gemini
- Automatically saves to database
- Updates user stats in real-time

**Frontend Usage:**
```typescript
const eventSource = new EventSource('/api/v1/stream/chat');

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  
  if (data.type === 'token') {
    // Append token to display
    appendToken(data.content);
  } else if (data.type === 'done') {
    // Response complete
    eventSource.close();
  }
};
```

**Portfolio Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- Shows real-time data handling
- Advanced frontend/backend integration
- Modern UX patterns

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Connect Dashboard to Real Data:

Update `/dashboard/page.tsx` to fetch real analytics:

```typescript
'use client'

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { apiClient } from '@/lib/api'

export default function DashboardPage() {
  const [analytics, setAnalytics] = useState(null)
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)

  useEffect(() => {
    async function fetchAnalytics() {
      try {
        const data = await apiClient.getAnalytics()
        setAnalytics(data)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to fetch analytics:', error)
      } finally {
        setLoading(false)
      }
    }
    
    fetchAnalytics()
  }, [])

  // Use real data instead of mock data
  const stats = analytics?.user?.stats || mockStats
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### Add Streaming to Chat:

```typescript
// In learn/page.tsx
const handleStreamingMessage = async (message: string) => {
  const eventSource = new EventSource(
    `/api/v1/stream/chat?message=${encodeURIComponent(message)}`
  )

  let fullResponse = ''

  eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
    
    if (data.type === 'token') {
      fullResponse += data.content
      // Update UI with streaming text
      setStreamingText(fullResponse)
    } else if (data.type === 'done') {
      eventSource.close()
      // Finalize message
      addMessage(fullResponse)
    }
  }
}
```
